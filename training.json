          "recommended_routine": "Use a gentle, cream-based cleanser that won't strip away moisture. Apply a rich moisturizer (oil-in-water emulsions like lotions, gels, or serums that hydrate) right after cleansing, and reapply as needed. Always use a broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 30+ daily (ideally a moisturizing formula). Choose a moisturizing makeup or primer base if you wear makeup. Dry skin benefits from occasional gentle exfoliation (e.g. a mild AHA) to remove flaky cells, but always follow with moisturizer to prevent irritation.",
          "additional_tips": "Avoid long, hot showers which can further dry out skin; use a humidifier in dry climates. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, ceramides, and natural oils in products to help retain moisture. Use fragrance-free products if prone to eczema or sensitivity."

          "description": "Oily skin produces excess sebum, leading to a shiny appearance and enlarged-looking pores, especially in the T-zone. It may be prone to acne and blackheads.",
          "recommended_routine": "Cleanse gently twice a day with a water-soluble cleanser that removes oil without over-drying (avoid harsh, alcohol-based cleansers). After cleansing, you can apply any acne treatments or toners as needed. Use a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer (yes, even oily skin needs moisture) – ideally one with broad-spectrum SPF 30 for daytime. If your moisturizer doesn't have SPF, apply a separate non-comedogenic sunscreen. Opt for matte, water-based makeup if you use it, to avoid adding shine or oil. Oily skin can benefit from exfoliation 1-2 times a week (for example, a salicylic acid product) to keep pores clear, but don't overdo it and always moisturize after exfoliating.",
          "additional_tips": "Blotting papers or a light dusting of powder can help manage midday shine. Non-comedogenic (\"won't clog pores\") products are essential. Avoid scrubbing skin harshly; it won't reduce oil and can irritate skin into producing more oil. Consistent, gentle care will balance oil production better in the long run."

        "combination_skin": {
          "description": "Combination skin has both oily and dry areas (commonly an oily forehead/nose/chin with drier cheeks). Different parts of the face have different needs.",
          "recommended_routine": "Treat each area appropriately: apply oil-absorbing, mattifying products only on oily zones (e.g. T-zone), and use richer creams or hydrating serums only on dry patches. Use a gentle cleanser that cleans oily areas without over-drying the dry parts. Opt for fragrance-free, alcohol-free toners and avoid irritating ingredients, since both oily and dry areas can react poorly to harsh products. Use a non-comedogenic lotion for overall hydration – apply a lighter layer on oily parts and a heavier layer on dry parts. Sunscreen should be lightweight (gel or fluid) to avoid greasiness in oily areas; you can even use a matte finish sunscreen on the T-zone. If needed, you might use two different moisturizers (an oil-free one for oily areas, a creamier one for dry areas). Adjust your routine as your skin changes – for example, in humid weather you may need less moisturizer, whereas in winter you may need more on dry areas.",
          "additional_tips": "Precision is key: some people \"multi-mask\" by applying a clay mask only on oily areas and a hydrating mask on dry areas. Avoid over-layering too many products on the entire face; instead, target application by zone. Make sure all products are gentle and avoid excessive fragrance or alcohol which can aggravate both dryness and oiliness. Using a gentle chemical exfoliant (like a glycolic acid) occasionally can help keep skin balanced, but be sure to moisturize any dry areas immediately afterward."

        "sensitive_skin": {
          "description": "Sensitive skin is easily irritated by products or environmental factors. It may itch, burn, or get red and stinging when certain cosmetics or skincare products are applied. This skin type often overlaps with conditions like rosacea, eczema, or allergies.",
          "recommended_routine": "Simplify your routine: use as few products as possible and choose those with gentle, minimal ingredients. A mild, fragrance-free, hypoallergenic cleanser and a bland moisturizer (with no perfumes or common irritants) are key. Avoid products with alcohol, artificial fragrance, or harsh exfoliants. Always patch-test new products on a small area of skin before using them broadly. Apply a moisturizer twice a day to help strengthen the skin barrier and reduce reactivity. Sunscreen is important (sensitive skin still needs UV protection), but use physical filters like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, or sunscreens specifically labeled for sensitive skin to minimize chances of irritation. Introduce any active ingredients (like retinol or vitamin C) very slowly, in low concentrations, and if irritation occurs, discontinue use.",
          "additional_tips": "Look for labels such as \"for sensitive skin\" or \"dermatologist tested,\" but still scrutinize the ingredient list – the shorter, the better. Often, simple products like pure aloe vera gel or products with colloidal oatmeal can soothe sensitive skin. If a product causes burning or redness, wash it off and stop using it. In general, less is more – stick to basic cleansing, moisturizing, and sun protection. If you have a condition like rosacea or persistent dermatitis, consult a dermatologist for tailored guidance."

        "normal_skin": {
          "description": "Normal skin is well-balanced – not too oily or too dry, with few sensitivities or blemishes. Pores are generally small, skin texture is smooth, and the skin doesn't produce excess shine or flakes.",
          "recommended_routine": "Normal skin benefits from a consistent basic routine to maintain its health. Cleanse with a gentle face wash to remove impurities without stripping moisture. Use a light moisturizer to keep skin hydrated and support the barrier. Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every morning to prevent cumulative sun damage. Normal skin can generally tolerate a wider range of products, so you can incorporate serums (like a vitamin C antioxidant serum in the morning) or a mild retinol at night for preventive care against aging, but introduce them one at a time to ensure your skin tolerates them. Exfoliate periodically (for instance, once a week) with a gentle scrub or AHA to maintain radiance and smooth texture, but avoid over-exfoliating which could disrupt the skin's balance.",
          "additional_tips": "Even normal skin can have occasional minor issues (like a random pimple or a bit of dullness), so adjust your routine if needed – for example, do an extra clay mask if you get a little oily in the T-zone in summer, or use a richer moisturizer if your skin gets drier in winter. Continue healthy lifestyle habits (good diet, hydration, not smoking, managing stress) to support your skin's condition. Essentially, protect the skin from damage and don't neglect daily care, even if it appears \"low-maintenance.\""

          "management": "Gently wash the face up to twice daily with a mild, non-abrasive cleanser (avoid scrubbing, which can irritate). Use over-the-counter treatments containing ingredients like salicylic acid (to unclog pores) or benzoyl peroxide (to reduce acne-causing bacteria) on problem areas. At night, applying a retinoid (retinol or adapalene) can help prevent clogged pores and improve skin cell turnover – start slowly (a few times a week) to minimize irritation. Always follow treatments with a non-comedogenic moisturizer to prevent dryness (dehydrated skin can actually produce more oil). In the morning, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen daily, since many acne medications make skin more sun-sensitive and UV exposure can worsen dark spots. Choose an oil-free, non-comedogenic sunscreen so it doesn't aggravate acne. Avoid picking or popping pimples, as this can cause scars and dark marks. With consistent care, acne often improves in a few weeks; if you have severe or cystic acne that isn't responding to routine, see a dermatologist for therapies like prescription retinoids, benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin gels, or even oral medications for more serious cases."

        "eczema": {
          "description": "Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a chronic condition where the skin's barrier is weak, leading to dry, itchy, and inflamed patches. Skin may crack, peel, or appear red/brownish and very itchy. Flare-ups come and go, often triggered by irritants, allergens, or weather changes.",
          "management": "The primary treatment is to keep skin well-moisturized and avoid irritants. Use thick moisturizers (cream or ointment rather than lotion) at least twice a day – especially right after bathing – to lock in moisture and protect the skin barrier. Bathe or shower in warm (not hot) water for only 5-10 minutes, and use a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser sparingly (only on dirty or affected areas). After bathing, pat skin lightly with a towel (do not fully dry out) and immediately apply moisturizer while skin is still slightly damp. Stick to fragrance-free, hypoallergenic products (soaps, detergents, laundry products) to reduce irritation. To help with intense itching, you can apply cool compresses or use over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy spots (short-term), but if the eczema is moderate or severe, a dermatologist can prescribe stronger steroid or non-steroid creams to calm inflammation. Avoid scratching as much as possible – keeping nails short and maybe wearing soft cotton gloves at night can reduce skin damage from scratching. Identify and try to avoid personal triggers that worsen eczema (such as certain fabrics like wool, overheating and sweat, harsh soaps, or specific allergens). Using a humidifier in dry environments and keeping indoor temperature moderate can also help prevent excessive drying of the skin."

        "rosacea": {
          "description": "Rosacea is a skin condition characterized by chronic redness and flushing on the face (especially the nose and cheeks), often with small acne-like bumps or visible blood vessels. The skin may be very sensitive; flare-ups can be triggered by heat, spicy foods, alcohol, stress, and other factors.",
          "management": "Be very gentle with cleansing and care: wash your face with a mild, non-irritating cleanser using just your fingertips (no rough washcloths) and lukewarm water. Apply a gentle moisturizer twice a day to protect the skin barrier and reduce irritation. Sun protection is crucial – wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every day, because sunlight is a common trigger for rosacea and can worsen redness. Try to identify your personal triggers and avoid them: common rosacea triggers include sun and heat, emotional stress, hot beverages, spicy foods, and alcohol (especially red wine). Minimizing these can reduce flare-ups. Use skincare and cosmetics designed for sensitive skin – avoid products with fragrance, menthol, alcohol, or other irritants. Green-tinted makeup primers or moisturizers can help neutralize redness under foundation. For persistent rosacea symptoms (like acne-like bumps or severe redness), see a dermatologist. They may prescribe topical treatments such as metronidazole, azelaic acid, or ivermectin creams, or oral medications for more severe cases. Laser or light therapies can also reduce visible blood vessels or redness if needed."
        },
        "hyperpigmentation": {
          "description": "Hyperpigmentation refers to patches of skin that become darker than the surrounding area due to excess melanin. Examples include post-acne dark spots (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), sun spots (age spots), or melasma (brown patches often due to hormonal changes). This issue can affect all skin tones, though dark spots may persist longer and be more noticeable on medium to deep skin tones.",
          "management": "Sun protection is the foundation of treating hyperpigmentation. Daily use of broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) prevents spots from darkening and new ones from forming. Dermatologists often recommend a tinted sunscreen with iron oxide for skin of color, as it protects against visible light which can worsen melasma and dark spots. Wear sun-protective clothing and seek shade, since even brief sun exposures accumulate. To fade existing hyperpigmentation, incorporate topical ingredients that brighten skin and/or slow melanin production: vitamin C, niacinamide, azelaic acid, kojic acid, glycolic or lactic acid (AHAs), and retinoids are all options proven to help. Over-the-counter serums or creams with these ingredients, used consistently, can gradually lighten dark spots over a period of months. Consistency is key – it often takes 8-12 weeks (or longer) to see noticeable improvement, and deeper discoloration can take 6-12 months or more to fade significantly. Avoid harsh scrubs or irritants that could inflame the skin, as new irritation can trigger more pigmentation. If OTC products aren't sufficient, a dermatologist can offer stronger treatments like prescription hydroquinone, tretinoin, chemical peels, or laser therapy to break up pigment. But even with treatments, continuing strict sun protection is crucial to prevent recurrence."
        },
        "aging_skin": {
          "description": "Aging or mature skin gradually loses collagen, elastin, and moisture. Over time this leads to fine lines, wrinkles, sagging, thinner skin, drier texture, and often uneven tone or age spots (especially from sun exposure).",
          "management": "The best strategy for aging skin is prevention plus targeted skincare. Always use sunscreen and moisturizer – the American Academy of Dermatology emphasizes that broad-spectrum SPF and a good moisturizer are the two most effective over-the-counter anti-aging products. Sun protection prevents further UV damage (the primary cause of premature aging), and moisturizer hydrates the skin so it appears plumper and smoother. In addition, incorporate proven anti-aging ingredients: retinoids (like retinol or prescription tretinoin) to boost collagen production and speed up cell turnover, thereby reducing wrinkles and improving texture; antioxidants such as vitamin C (and vitamin E) to neutralize free radicals and brighten the skin; peptides to support and firm the skin; and hyaluronic acid to draw in moisture and restore suppleness. A typical routine might include: a gentle cleanser, a morning antioxidant serum (e.g. vitamin C), followed by a moisturizer with SPF for daytime. At night, use a retinoid cream or serum, then layer a nourishing moisturizer on top. Don't forget the eye area – an eye cream with ingredients like caffeine, peptides, or niacinamide can help address crow's feet or puffiness. Beyond products, lifestyle plays a huge role: not smoking, eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats, regular exercise, adequate sleep, and stress management all help maintain youthful skin."
        },
        "dark_circles": {
          "description": "Dark circles under the eyes appear as a bluish, purple, or brownish discoloration in the under-eye area. They can result from thin under-eye skin (showing the blood vessels beneath), hyperpigmentation, genetics, lack of sleep, or hollowness/shadowing due to aging. Often they are accompanied by puffiness or a sunken appearance under the eyes.",
          "management": "Ensure you get sufficient sleep and stay hydrated – fatigue and dehydration can worsen under-eye circles. In the morning, a cold compress (such as chilled spoons, cold tea bags, or a cold damp washcloth) over the eyes for several minutes can constrict blood vessels and reduce swelling, making circles less pronounced. Use an eye cream with brightening or firming ingredients: vitamin C can help lighten pigmentation under the eyes, caffeine can help reduce puffiness by constricting blood vessels, and peptides or retinol (formulated for eyes) can thicken the skin and smooth fine lines over time. Always be gentle with application – tap creams on with your ring finger rather than rubbing. Apply a daily sunscreen (or use sunglasses) to protect the under-eye area from UV damage that can worsen discoloration. For immediate cosmetic improvement, use a concealer: a peach- or orange-tinted corrector can counteract bluish tones, followed by a concealer matching your skin tone."

        "razor_bumps": {
          "description": "Razor bumps (pseudofolliculitis barbae) occur after shaving when shaved hairs curl back into the skin, leading to pimple-like bumps and irritation. This is common in areas with coarse or curly hair.",
          "management": "Before shaving, soften the hair – shave at the end of a warm shower or apply a warm, damp towel to the area for a few minutes. Always use a lubricating shaving gel/cream and a sharp, clean razor. Shave in the direction that the hair grows (with the grain), not against it. Use light pressure and do not shave over the same area repeatedly. After shaving, rinse the skin with warm water and then cool water, and apply a soothing aftershave product – ideally alcohol-free with calming ingredients like aloe vera or witch hazel. Keep your razor blades fresh; replace a disposable blade after 5-7 uses. Some people find using a single-blade razor or electric clippers leads to fewer bumps."

        "large_pores": {
          "description": "Enlarged pores are visible, often circular openings on the skin surface. They are most noticeable in oily areas (nose, cheeks, forehead) and can make skin texture look uneven. Pore size is largely genetic, but pores can appear larger due to excess oil, clogging, or loss of skin elasticity with age.",
          "management": "You cannot actually shrink pores permanently, but you can make them look smaller. Keep pores clean to prevent stretching: cleanse your face twice a day to remove oil and dirt. Use non-comedogenic skincare and makeup. Regular gentle exfoliation helps: products with salicylic acid (BHA) can penetrate into pores and clear out debris. At night, applying a retinoid can increase cell turnover and boost collagen around pores, making them appear tighter over time. If you have oily skin, oil-controlling products like niacinamide can reduce sebum output and slightly minimize pore visibility. Always apply sunscreen daily – sun damage breaks down collagen and can make pores appear larger."

Wash only once or twice a week (or even less often for very tight coils); in between, you might co-wash (wash with conditioner only) to refresh hair without stripping oils. Use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo. Always apply a rich, slippery conditioner and detangle your hair while the conditioner is in, using your fingers or a wide-tooth comb. Do not brush curly hair when it's dry. After rinsing conditioner, apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to soaking wet hair to lock in moisture.

You might need to wash straight hair more frequently because oil is more visible. When using conditioner, apply it mainly to the ends. To boost volume, you can blow-dry hair upside down – but always use a heat protectant. A dry shampoo can be used between washes to soak up excess oil.
