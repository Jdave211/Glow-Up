Hormonal changes, genetics, and inflammation all play a role in breakouts.\n\n## How to Manage Acne\n\nGently wash the face up to twice daily with a mild, non-abrasive cleanser (avoid scrubbing, which can irritate). Use over-the-counter treatments containing ingredients like salicylic acid (to unclog pores) or benzoyl peroxide (to reduce acne-causing bacteria) on problem areas. At night, applying a retinoid (retinol or adapalene) can help prevent clogged pores and improve skin cell turnover – start slowly (a few times a week) to minimize irritation. Always follow treatments with a non-comedogenic moisturizer to prevent dryness (dehydrated skin can actually produce more oil). In the morning, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen daily, since many acne medications make skin more sun-sensitive and UV exposure can worsen dark spots. Choose an oil-free, non-comedogenic sunscreen so it doesn't aggravate acne. Avoid picking or popping pimples, as this can cause scars and dark marks.

Examples include post-acne dark spots (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation), sun spots (age spots), or melasma (brown patches often due to hormonal changes). This issue can affect all skin tones, though dark spots may persist longer and be more noticeable on medium to deep skin tones.\n\n## How to Manage Hyperpigmentation\n\nSun protection is the foundation of treating hyperpigmentation. Daily use of broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) prevents spots from darkening and new ones from forming. Dermatologists often recommend a tinted sunscreen with iron oxide for skin of color, as it protects against visible light which can worsen melasma and dark spots. Wear sun-protective clothing and seek shade, since even brief sun exposures accumulate. To fade existing hyperpigmentation, incorporate topical ingredients that brighten skin and/or slow melanin production: vitamin C, niacinamide, azelaic acid, kojic acid, glycolic or lactic acid (AHAs), and retinoids are all options proven to help. Over-the-counter serums or creams with these ingredients, used consistently, can gradually lighten dark spots over a period of months. Consistency is key – it often takes 8-12 weeks (or longer) to see noticeable improvement, and deeper discoloration can take 6-12 months or more to fade significantly. Avoid harsh scrubs or irritants that could inflame the skin, as new irritation can trigger more pigmentation. If OTC products aren't sufficient, a dermatologist can offer stronger treatments like prescription hydroquinone, tretinoin, chemical peels, or laser therapy to break up pigment.

They can result from thin under-eye skin (showing the blood vessels beneath), hyperpigmentation, genetics, lack of sleep, or hollowness/shadowing due to aging. Often they are accompanied by puffiness or a sunken appearance under the eyes.\n\n## How to Manage Dark Circles\n\nEnsure you get sufficient sleep and stay hydrated – fatigue and dehydration can worsen under-eye circles. In the morning, a cold compress (such as chilled spoons, cold tea bags, or a cold damp washcloth) over the eyes for several minutes can constrict blood vessels and reduce swelling, making circles less pronounced.

Focus conditioner on the mid-lengths and ends of your hair (the oldest, driest parts) to keep them moisturized and reduce breakage.\n\n- Limit heat styling (blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons). When you do use heat, apply a heat protectant product beforehand to minimize damage.\n\n- Be gentle when hair is wet – wet hair is more fragile. Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle, starting from the ends and working upward.\n\n- Protect hair from friction and pulling: use fabric-covered hair ties or scrunchies instead of tight elastics.\n\n- Trim your hair regularly (every 6-12 weeks) to snip off split ends.\n\n- Maintain a balanced diet rich in protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins – since hair is made of protein, nutritional deficiencies can weaken hair.\n\n- If you color, bleach, or chemically relax your hair, invest in proper care: use products made for color-treated hair and deep condition frequently.\n\n---\n\nHealthy hair is a journey, not a destination — stay consistent! 💕"}]}

Use a gentle, moisturizing shampoo and always follow with conditioner, especially on the ends. Regularly moisturize between washes with leave-in conditioners or hair oils/butters. Incorporate hot oil treatments about twice a month. Be cautious with chemical relaxers – have them done professionally and only on new growth.
